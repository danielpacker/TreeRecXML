= Description =

The code here represents the development of a working perl/BioPerl 
implementation of tree reconciliation representations in XML.

This code will, during summer of 2011, be integrated into the iPlant
tree reconciliation project, and act as a proof of concept for XML
mappings of tree reconciliation. The hope is that a successful 
implementation will pave the road for other developers to use
this XML schema across the board for interoperable GTR data.
