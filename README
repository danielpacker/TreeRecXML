= Description =

The work here represents the development of a working perl/BioPerl 
implementation of tree reconciliation representations in XML.

This code will, during summer of 2011, be integrated into the iPlant
tree reconciliation project, and act as a proof of concept for XML
mappings of tree reconciliation. The hope is that a successful 
implementation will pave the road for other developers to use
this XML schema across the board for interoperable GTR data.

All code is in development, so no guarantee is provided by myself or my sponsors.
